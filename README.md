# Blog Web App

Welcome to the Blog Web App! This web application is built using React, Express, MongoDB, React Router, React Query, and JWT for authentication. It offers a range of cool features, including user authentication with JWT, creating and deleting your own blogs, adding comments and likes to blogs, and user profiles Once you log in, you don't have to login again until you logout by using localStorage to persist user session.

## Features

- User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and access their accounts securely using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Create and Delete Blogs: Authenticated users can create new blogs and delete their own blogs.
- Comment and Like Blogs: Users can add comments and like blogs to engage with the content.
- User Profiles: Each user has a profile displaying their blogs.

Welcome to the Blog Web App! This web application is built using React, Express, MongoDB, React Router, React Query, and JWT for authentication. It offers a range of cool features, including user authentication with JWT, creating and deleting your own blogs, adding comments and likes to blogs, and user profiles. Once you log in, you don't have to login again until you logout by using localStorage to persist user session.
